**What do we expect from you in the final project paper?**

1. Level of originality

* Undergraduates (9.66/6.804): Don’t have to do ‘original research’, you can implement and explore an existing model, but you do have to do original things with it in your exploration.  Think of it as like a pset but where you write the pset yourself. 

<!-- * Graduates (9.660): The project must represent ‘original research’ in some way \-- a new model, algorithm, or substantively new application of existing techniques.  The kind of work you would submit to a cog sci or AI/ML conference.  But it doesn’t have to be polished or even ‘good’.   -->

2. Relevance to the class\!
     
   Your report should reflect the tools and techniques you’ve learned **in this class** during the semester. We encourage you to connect your project to other research you’re doing, for a thesis or UROP, but you can’t just turn in other work for your class project.  Your proposal should explain how this relates to other work you’re doing for credit, and how it differs from or goes beyond it.   
     
   In your report, you should write about *what* worked and / or didn’t work in the project, and more importantly, *why* it did or did not work, as well as the *implications* of the results in the context of human cognition. For instance, it will be impressive if your model fits very well with the human data, but we are more interested in what this result implies about how our mind works.

<!-- 3. Amount of work  
     
   Generally, projects are done individually or in teams of two. If you’re looking to do the project with a group of 3 or more, you should talk to the TAs and get special permission.  
     
   You can work in groups, but a bigger team will mean we expect a **more substantial** project (roughly proportional to the number of people), and most likely **more involved** writeup. Also, everyone has to do something distinct, and you will have to submit a contribution statement. In addition, **everyone must contribute in some way to both the modeling and the writeup.**   -->
     
<!-- Easiest to upload GitHub repo then download? Would like this to be public facing regardless. -->
4. Content to be submitted  
     
   Submit your report as a pdf file and, for documentation purposes, add a zip file  
   containing critical supporting material (code, data you collected, analysis scripts, figures; large datasets/corpora don’t have to be included; only include the essentials and keep the zip file small\!)

<!-- Already completed this and below -->
<!-- **What do project proposals look like?** 

Proposals are the same for undergrad and grad projects. Your proposal should be between ½ and 1 page. In a few sentences, with a supporting figure or sketch if necessary, your proposal should include:

* What is the phenomenon or domain you want to study?  
* Why is it interesting?  
* What is the specific research question that you’re hoping to answer with your project?  
* What is the relevant background to understand this question?   
* What, concretely, are you proposing to do to answer this question (e.g., collect experimental data, implement and/or compare computational models, analyze existing datasets, etc.). You do not need to go into extensive detail \- bullet points are fine.  
* In a references section at the end of your document, include citations for any work that you cite in your proposal (typically this will contain between 1–3 references).  
* In addition:   
  * List all the students working on this project and their registration status (undergraduate, graduate) at the top of the document.  
  * Please state on the top of the page whether this is a project from the TA-endorsed list, a external mentor-advised project, or your own proposal, and state the name of the TA/external mentor. (If you have discussed this project with one of the TAs during office hours, please include their names here as well.)  
  * If your proposal is related to other research you are doing for another class/UROP/etc. please briefly state how your project differs/extend this past work

PDF submissions are encouraged. -->

# From the Canvas

The 'official' due date is Tuesday (December 9), but you can turn it in until 6pm on Tuesday (December 16) without a late penalty. 

- Overall guidelines: Here
- Page count: 5-6 pages minimum (excluding references, including figures)
- Style: follow submission guidelines for Cognitive Science conference submissions. I highly recommend using the following Overleaf template: https://v2.overleaf.com/read/wwwzyhdxtyhgLinks to an external site.. Make sure to uncomment the "\cogscifinalcopy" command to remove anonymity before submitting.
- Recommended sections to include: Introduction, Related Work, Methods, Results, Discussion. However, you are welcome to add additional sections if appropriate.
- Important: In addition, please include a statement of author contributions at the end of your paper, describing how each group member contributed to the project.
- If you wrote code for your project, either include a link to a GitHub repo in the text of the paper or upload as a zip file.
- Please specify which version of the class you're taking (9.66/9.660)
- Submission format: Submit as PDF on Canvas.
- Only 1 person per group needs to submit, but make sure to list all authors and author email addresses in the paper.
